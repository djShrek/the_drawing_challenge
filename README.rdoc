The drawing challenge is a drawing contest website.

We are using the figaro gem to manage credentials.

Copy config/application.yml.sample to config/applicaiton.yml to access the facebook dev app.



Users can log in with their Facebook account.

User can be an administrator

Administrator should be able to create challenges

Make some kind of admin panel where administrator can create a challenge

Challenge has title, start time, end time, description, embedded images

Challenges can have participants

The Challenge title, details etc are hidden until an artist participates (or the challenge is revealed for everyone)

Everyone can see the avatars of the participants

Artists can earn rewards or badges or points for consecutive participation

Artists may be publicly shamed if they fail to submit

Artists need a way to submit artwork for a challenge, allow for uploading iterations and declaring which iteration is the one you want to have voted on

after challenge ends, each new user to the site will be prompted to vote for 3 days

some moderation or flagging tools

Each week there is a single featured challenge, pulled in by cron

The site should be mobile responsive

When artist submits artwork also posts to their facebook?  Or have the option to control.
